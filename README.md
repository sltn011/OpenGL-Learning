# OpenGL-Learning
My code from learning OpenGL with book from https://learnopengl.com/

OpenGLTools is a library by me that encapsulates some of boilerplate OpenGL code  
Engines folder right now contains my first OpenGL engine made by me for learning and testing purposes. It's still far from being great but I'm working on it
  
Code requires GLAD OpenGL Loader, GLFW, GLM and STB_Image libraries  
GLAD: https://glad.dav1d.de/  
GLFW: https://www.glfw.org/  
GLM: https://glm.g-truc.net/0.9.9/index.html  
STB_Image: https://github.com/nothings/stb/blob/master/stb_image.h  
Assimp: https://github.com/assimp/assimp  

To compile examples set paths to required libraries in CMakeLists.txt and use CMake to generate compile files
